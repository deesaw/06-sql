Select LAST n records from a table
Write a query to select the last N records from a table…
Or
Explain the below query…
select * from emp
minus
select * from emp where rownum <=
 (select count(*) - &n from emp);
Answer:
We all know when you execute a SQL statement, sub query is the one which is executed first.
Step1: So if you run statement "select count(*) - &n from emp" and think EMP table has 10 rows
and N value is 3. The output for below SQL statement will be 10 - 3, ie 7
Step2: Now oracle takes 7 and execute the SQL statement as "select * from emp where rownum <=
7", which willl fetch the first 7 rows.
Step3: Now oracle runs SQL statement "select * from emp", which willl fetch all the 10 rows
Step4: Now oracle takes the 10 rows from step3 and subtracts the

Find the LAST inserted record in a table
Write a query to find the LAST inserted record in a table.
Answer:
If you want the last record inserted, you need to have a timestamp or sequence number assigned to each
record as they are inserted and then you can use the below query…
select * from t
where TIMESTAMP_COLUMN = (select max(timestamp_column) from T)
and rownum = 1; 

Find the number of rows in a table without using COUNT function
Write a query to find the number of rows in a table without using COUNT function.
Answer:
SELECT MAX(rn) FROM
(
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY empno DESC) as rn FROM emp
)

Maximum salary without using functions
Write a query to find the maximum salary from the EMP table without using functions.
Answer:
We can achieve this by using the SELF joins.
select * from emp
where sal not in
(
select A.sal
from emp A, emp B
where A.sal < B.sal
)

More than 2 employees Question
Write a query to display the employee information, who have more than 2 employees under a
manager
Answer:
We can achieve this by using the COUNT analytical function.
select * from
(
SELECT e.*, count(mgr) over (partition by mgr) as cnt
from emp e
)
where cnt >= 2

Odd/Even rows Question
Write a query to display even/odd number rows from a table.
Answer:
We can achieve this by using the ROWNUM pseudo column.
select * from

 from emp
 order by empno
 )
where mod (rn, 2) <> 0
order by rn

2
nd way
select * from emp

 (select sal from emp
 group by sal
 having count(sal)>=2
 )
3
rd way

SELECT e.*, count(*) Over (Partition BY sal ORDER BY sal) cnt
FROM emp e
)
WHERE cnt>=2;


Select/Delete duplicate rows from EMP table

Answer:
We can achieve this by using the pseudo column ROWID.
select * from emp
where rowid not in
(
select min(rowid)
 from emp
 group by empno

delete from emp
where rowid not in
(
select min(rowid)

Select top N salaries from each Department of EMP table
Write a query to select top N salaries from each department of the EMP table
(or)
Write a query to select maximum N salaries from each department of the EMP table
Answer:
We can achieve this by using the DENSE_RANK Analytical function. In the below example we are
getting the TOP 3 salaries for each department of the EMP table.
select * from
(
select e.*,
DENSE_RANK() over (partition by deptno order by sal DESC) RN
from emp e
)
where RN <=3

Select top N salaries from EMP table
Write a query to select top N salaries from the EMP table
(or)
Write a query to select maximum N salaries from the EMP table
Answer:
We can achieve this by using the DENSE_RANK Analytical function. In the below example we are
getting the TOP 5 salaries from the EMP table.
select * from
(
select e.*,
DENSE_RANK() over (order by sal DESC) RN
from emp e
)
where RN <=5


Select top N salaries from EMP table
Write a query to select top N salaries from the EMP table
(or)
Write a query to select maximum N salaries from the EMP table
Answer:
We can achieve this by using the DENSE_RANK Analytical function. In the below example we are
getting the TOP 5 salaries from the EMP table.
select * from
(
select e.*,
DENSE_RANK() over (order by sal DESC) RN
from emp e
)
where RN <=5

select * from
(
select e.*,
DENSE_RANK() over (order by sal DESC) RN
from emp e
)
where RN <=5


Select Nth maximum salary from a table
Write a query to select Nth maximum salary from EMP table
(or)
Write a query to find 2nd, 3rd max salary from EMP table
(or)
Write a query to find 10 highest salary
(Or)
Write a query to find 4th highest salary (without analytical function)
Answer:
We can achieve this by using the correlated sub query. In the below example we are getting the 5th
highest salary without using the Analytical function.
select *
from emp emp1
where (5-1) =
(
select count(distinct(emp2.sal))
from emp emp2
where emp2.sal > emp1.sal
)
In the below example we are getting the 5th highest salary by using the Analytical function.
select * from
(
select e.*,
DENSE_RANK() over (order by sal DESC) RN
from emp e
)
where RN=5


Updatable View Experiment
The "WITH CHECK OPTION" is used to prevent changes to a view that would produce rows that are
not included in a query.
Example:
CREATE VIEW v_dept20 AS SELECT ename, sal, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno = 20;
View created.
UPDATE v_dept20 SET deptno = 10;
5 rows updated.
By changing the DEPTNO value to 10, now the user can see the details of all the employees in department
10. This violated the fundamental purpose of the view of showing only the department 20 details.
Solution:
Recreate the view with "WITH CHECK OPTION" so that Oracle will prevent the changes to the view.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_dept20
AS
SELECT ename, sal, deptno FROM emp
WHERE deptno = 20
WITH CHECK OPTION;
UPDATE v_dept20 SET deptno = 10;
When you run the above update, you will get the below error, thus preventing the user from
updating the view.
UPDATE v_dept20 SET deptno = 10
 *
ERROR at line 1: ORA-01402: view WITH CHECK OPTION where-clause violation
